## Live Entertainment DataBase 

Live Entertainment DataBase (LEDB) is my own version of IMDB. Intended as a sample of my Laravel 4 coding, we may use it to record live entertainment events locally. Some such events are local theater productions, local live music, etc.

Primary goal is to have some Laravel 4-based application not owned by an employer of mine, so I can freely demo it to other folks.
Secondary goal is to possibly use LEDB for its stated purpose, giving a broader voice to small, local live entertainment productions and artists.
